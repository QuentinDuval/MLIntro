    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything we have done in the part 1 for static or dynamic game, perfect or imperfect information (where imperfect is related to simulatenous moves and chance) was based on the assumption that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All players know the game, including the possible actions and payoffs of all other players\n",
    "2. All players know that other players know and so on recursively (**knowledge is common knowledge**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistically, we never quite know the payoff of other players. For instance, we might know the amount of money they might get from a deal, but not how much this money is really worth for them (the utility of money is very rarely the identity function).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Incomplete information\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything that players know about themselves but that other players do not know about them is encapsulated in what we call the **type of a player**. We will assume that players know the joint distribution of probability of types of players (**prior knowledge**) and that this knowledge is common knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **incomplete information game is a game in which players have types**. In such games, strategies of each players have to include their own type as argument, and the value function of each player depend on the type of the player and might also depend on the types of other players as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivational example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the market entry game, the only sub-game perfect equilibrium is for the player 1 to enter the market, and for the player 2 to accept this entry. This is what a pair of *rational* player would do.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"width:50%;float:right;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"img/market_entry_game.svg\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "But **rational is relative to the payoffs**, the values that each player place on each outcome. There is no judgement whatsoever on how these payoffs are evaluated and they can be something else than money.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some types of player 2, the outcome of fight is -1/2 instead of -1/-1, because this player is not so much interested about money than feeling unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "If player 1 is uncertain about the **intrinsic motives** of player 2, then we can introduce types to differentiate between these behaviors."

    "# Static Bayesian Game of Incomplete information\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A static bayesian game of incomplete information is the equivalent with types of the static game with moves that can be either simultaneous or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A game of *N* player is composed for the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A set of actions $\\{A\\}_n$ for each of the *N* players\n",
    "* A set of types $\\{\\Theta\\}_n$ for each of the *N* players\n",
    "* A set of probabilities $\\{\\phi\\}_n = p(\\theta_{-i}|\\theta_i)$ where $\\theta_i$ is the player type and $\\theta_{-i}$ is the opponents' types\n",
    "* Value functions $\\{v\\}_n$ for each player (which takes tall types as input)\n",
    "\n",
    "The games unfolds in the following order: each player gets its type and gets to know its own type, then all players pick an action, and then the payoffs are realized by calling the function $v_i$ for each player *i*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayesian Nash equilibrium\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Bayesian Nash equilibrium** is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that none of the player, whatever is type, has any benefit in deviating from it. It is the same concept as a Nash equilibrium, but for the fact that each player has to formulate one strategy for each of its types, and that this strategy must be the **best response in expectation** for the distribution of types of opponents:\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; $\\displaystyle \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta_{-i}}[v_i(s, \\theta_i)] \\ge \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta_{-i}}[v_i(s', \\theta_i)]$\n",
    "&emsp; where *s'* is *s* with a different move for player *i*\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the strategy of player *i* is the best response for each of its type (highest payoff with opponents' actions fixed), the expectation of its payoff is at its highest point as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; $\\displaystyle \\mathbb{E}_{\\Theta}[v_i(s, \\theta_i)] \\ge \\mathbb{E}_{\\Theta}[v_i(s', \\theta_i)]$\n",
    "&emsp; where *s'* is *s* with a different move for player *i*\n",
    "\n",
    "So it turns out that to find the Nash equilibrium, **we can solve an incomplete game with the same tools as an imperfect game**: we do not need one normal form matrix for each player $i$, and each type $\\theta_i$, we can still use a single normal form matrix and look for deviation of individual player best responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For player $j \\ne i$, it appears that player $i$ is playing a mixed strategy\n",
    "2. For player $i$, maximizing its \"mixed strategy\" is equivalent to maximzing all types\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Game of chicken\n",
    "\n",
    "Two players are heading for a fight. Each player needs to decide whether he fight **F** or backs off **B**. If both backoff, nothing happens and the payoff is 0/0. If one backs off, he gets 0 and the other gets 10. If both fights, the payoff is $10-\\theta_i$ for each player, where $\\theta_i$ depends on whether the player is strong (5) or weak (12).\n",
